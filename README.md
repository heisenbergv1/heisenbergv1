## 🤔 Frequently Asked (and Mildly Concerning) Questions

### Q: What are you doing as a Software Engineer?
**A:** Most days we act like a product manager & designer. ChatGPT is our extremely enthusiastic intern—great at memory, surprisingly okay at vibes. The real job? Knowing **what** to build, **why** it matters, and **how** to build & ship it.

> TL;DR: We architect, design, and orchestrate. The code is the soundtrack.

### Q: How do we become an expert “vibe coder”?
**A:** Start by treating curiosity like a superpower. Ask weird, out-of-the-box, sideways questions. Pair intuition with first-principles thinking. You just vibe most of the time. But, there are hard times you must use curse words so ChatGPT truly understands your meaning.

> TL;DR: Vibes + rigor = senior energy.

### 💡 About the Name

The pseudonym **“heisenbergv1”** is a nod to **Werner Heisenberg**, the physicist behind the *Uncertainty Principle* — the idea that observation itself affects reality.  

The “**v1**” reminds me that every project — like every theory — begins with a **version one**, and improvement is an ongoing process of iteration and refinement.

Although my background is in **pragmatic software engineering**, I’m deeply drawn to **Physics and Mathematics** — not just as sciences, but as philosophies of precision, symmetry, and truth-seeking. 
I try to bring that same rigor and curiosity into code design, architecture, and system thinking.

> “In both physics and programming, clarity is not simplicity — it’s understanding the complexity so deeply that it looks simple.”
