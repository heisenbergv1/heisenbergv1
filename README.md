<h1 align="center">👋 Hi, I'm <span style="color:#58a6ff;">heisenbergv</span></h1>


💻 **Full-Stack Engineer** | 🧠 **Software Engineer** (w/ positive vibes)

I design and build modern web systems — from .NET backends to React/Next.js frontends — with strong DevOps and performance discipline.  

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** C#, TypeScript, SQL, PHP, Python  
- **Frameworks:** .NET 8, ASP.NET Core, Next.js / React, Laravel, Unity 6 URP  
- **Databases:** SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL (Supabase), Redis  
- **DevOps:** Docker, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure App Service  

---

### 🧩 Featured Projects (Serious)
- **[Yelra](https://github.com/heisenbergv1/yelra)** – New systems language inspired by Rust; aims for zero-cost ergonomics, affine/borrowed ownership, effect-typed async, and friendly tooling.
- **[Unity-CoinSim](https://github.com/heisenbergv1/unity-coin-toss-3d)** – A realistic 3D coin-physics simulation game built with Unity 6 (URP-optimized). Gamblers like me will love it. Coming soon…

### ✌ Just For Fun
- [Don Hector The Cat](https://ai-chatbot-nksn.vercel.app/) - you can talk to my AI cat if you have free time.
- [Math Problem Generator](https://math-problem-generator-pi.vercel.app/)
- [NoMod](#) - is a socmed app designed to take down Reddit-bs. This ends moderators’ gatekeeping. Value comes from character quality points, not nonsense karma politics.
- [JobSpy](https://github.com/heisenbergv1/JobSpy) / [jobscraper](https://github.com/heisenbergv1/jobscraper) - when the mood strikes, I politely (and occasionally ruthlessly) hammer job sites—like a berserker.

## 🤔 Frequently Asked (and Mildly Concerning) Questions

### Q: What are you doing as a Software Engineer?
**A:** Most days we act like a product manager & designer. ChatGPT is our extremely enthusiastic intern—great at memory, surprisingly okay at vibes. The real job? Knowing **what** to build, **why** it matters, and **how** to build & ship it.

> TL;DR: We architect, design, and orchestrate. The code is the soundtrack.

### Q: How do we become an expert “vibe coder”?
**A:** Start by treating curiosity like a superpower. Ask weird, out-of-the-box, sideways questions. Pair intuition with first-principles thinking. You just vibe most of the time. But, there are hard times you must use curse words so ChatGPT truly understands your meaning.

> TL;DR: Vibes + rigor = senior energy.

### 💡 About the Name

The pseudonym **“heisenbergv1”** is a nod to **Werner Heisenberg**, the physicist behind the *Uncertainty Principle* — the idea that observation itself affects reality.  

The “**v1**” reminds me that every project — like every theory — begins with a **version one**, and improvement is an ongoing process of iteration and refinement.

Although my background is in **pragmatic software engineering**, I’m deeply drawn to **Physics and Mathematics** — not just as sciences, but as philosophies of precision, symmetry, and truth-seeking. 
I try to bring that same rigor and curiosity into code design, architecture, and system thinking.

> “In both physics and programming, clarity is not simplicity — it’s understanding the complexity so deeply that it looks simple.”

🌀 Also a huge fan of **Dimple** from *Mob Psycho 100* — the most chaotic mentor spirit in anime history.
